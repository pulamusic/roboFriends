# NOTES

Used `npm create-react-app robofriends` to create the overall framework of this project.
* Installed the `create-react-app` feature globally.
* Use `npm start` to start the server.
* Note that es-lint hints are automatically printed in the terminal when using the server. Keep the terminal open.

This project uses [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) CSS framework in the `Cards.js` file. Read up on this.
* Added to [KanbanFlow](https://kanbanflow.com/board/Emz6zrrv) 3/1/2018.

Check out [robohash.org](https://robohash.org/) for cool robot graphics.
* Again, added to [KanbanFlow](https://kanbanflow.com/board/Emz6zrrv) 3/1/2018.

Used [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to create a mini-API for testing.

Notice how the React files are organized as separate components, making them re-usable.

Re-organized React files into `components` and `containers` directories. This will make it easier to keep things organized if the app continues to scale up.

Ran `npm run build` to optimize the app for deployment. I can now deploy the `build` folder as a web app.

**Copied the `build` folder to the `development` folder and renamed it `roboFriends` so I can deploy it as a GitHub Page**
* Check out the [GitHub Pages site](https://pulamusic.github.io/roboFriends/). NOTE: The site isn't currently working (3/2/18). I need to figure out a better way to deploy it.

#### Frustration!

> The instructor just blows through a bunch of stuff having to do with React, leaving me in the dust even though I have had some instruction in React already. I go back and forth as to whether this guy is a decent teacher.
